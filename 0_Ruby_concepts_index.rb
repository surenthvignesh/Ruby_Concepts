Ruby programming language. Here's a breakdown of Ruby concepts that will help you prepare:
'

1. Basic Syntax and Data Types
		Variables: Understanding local variables, global variables, instance variables, and class variables.
		Data types:
			Numbers (integers, floats)
			Strings, symbols
			Arrays, Hashes
			Booleans
		Operators: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

2. Control Flow
		Conditionals: if, else, elsif, and unless.
		Loops: while, until, for, and each.
		Break, next, and redo: Control the flow of loops.

3. Methods
		Defining and calling methods using def.
		Understanding method parameters (both required and optional).
		Using keyword arguments and default values.
		Variable number of arguments (using *args).

4. Classes and Objects
		Defining Classes: Using class to define a class.
		Instances and Class Variables: @variable for instance variables and @@variable for class variables.
		Class Methods vs Instance Methods: Understanding the difference and how to define them.
		Initialize method: The initialize method for object construction.
		Accessors: Using attr_reader, attr_writer, and attr_accessor.
		Inheritance: Subclassing with class Child < Parent.
		Method Overriding: Overriding methods in subclasses.

5. Modules
		Defining modules with module.
		Mixins: Using include and extend to include modules in classes.
		Namespacing: Using modules to avoid name collisions.

6. Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas
		Blocks: Understanding Ruby blocks, how to pass and yield to blocks.
		Procs: Creating and calling procs with Proc.new or lambda literals.
		Lambdas vs Procs: Differences between lambdas and procs in return behavior and argument handling.

7. Ruby Iterators and Enumerables
		Common iterators: each, map, select, reject, inject, collect.
		Enumerable Module: Understanding the Enumerable module and how methods like each, map, reduce are used with it.

8. Exception Handling
		Try/Rescue: Using begin, rescue, and ensure for handling exceptions.
		Custom Exceptions: Creating custom error classes with raise and rescue.

9. File I/O
		Reading from and writing to files using File.read, File.open, File.write.
		File Modes: r, w, a (read, write, append).

10. Garbage Collection
		How Ruby handles memory management automatically through garbage collection.
		Understanding how objects are automatically cleaned up when no longer in use.

11. Ruby on Rails (if applicable)
		If you're interviewing for a Ruby on Rails position, make sure to brush up on:'
		The MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
		Understanding ActiveRecord and database interactions.
		RESTful routing and controller actions.
		Views and templates (ERB).
		Common gems like devise (authentication), RSpec (testing), etc.

12. Testing in Ruby
		Using frameworks like RSpec and Minitest.
		Writing unit tests, integration tests, and mocking/stubbing.

13. Ruby Best Practices
		Writing clean, idiomatic Ruby code.
		Understanding DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and SOLID principles.
		Using Ruby Gems and knowing common libraries.

14. Performance Considerations
		Understanding how Ruby performs operations like string concatenation, array manipulation, and garbage collection.
		Benchmarking in Ruby and how to measure performance.

15. Ruby's Object-Oriented Features'
		Duck Typing: "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck."
		Polymorphism and Encapsulation: Principles of OOP that Ruby follows.
		Metaprogramming: Using send, method_missing, define_method, and other metaprogramming techniques to dynamically alter classes and objects at runtime.
